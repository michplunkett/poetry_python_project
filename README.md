# Poetry Python üêç Project Template
This repository is a template for a python üêç project using the poetry container. The intent is to do all the basic lifting for a python project so that people can hit the ground running with their ideas.

  - Example: `poetry add pytest`

## Standard Commands

- `make lint`: Runs `pytlint` on the codebase
- `make test`: Runs test cases in the `test` directory
- `make run`: Runs the `main` function in the `project` folder
